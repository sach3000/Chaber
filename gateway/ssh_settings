Changes in the system necessary for connection:

Linux OS no matter what, the main thing is sshd which already knows GatewayPorts

1. Create a user vncuser (with home and login), under it will be created tunnels
2. Add the ssh key for the user vncuser (vncuser.pub)

For SSHD, you need:

Port 443 - choose what is convenient, usually, 80, 443 are always open to the source
PermitRootLogin no
AllowTcpForwarding yes
GatewayPorts yes


All other parameters as you like.
